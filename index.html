                    resources. Curated by fellow developers who have the desire to help people 
                    fill the gap in their skills and those who learn on their own
                    but want a high quality education, it has bear fruit many successful individuals for many years. 
                    This is my own Odin Project. This site serves as the directory for my take on every project
